A software postmortem is a structured analysis conducted after significant software incidents, such as outages or security breaches, with the goal of understanding what went wrong, learning from the experience, and preventing similar incidents in the future. It borrows the concept from the medical field, where autopsies are performed to understand the causes of a patient's death.

The process involves preparation, a review of the incident's timeline and context, root cause analysis, and the generation of actionable recommendations. These recommendations are implemented to prevent future incidents, and a detailed report is created and shared with the team and the organization.

Software postmortems help teams identify the underlying causes of problems, whether technical, process-related, or human, and foster a culture of continuous improvement. They are essential for increasing system reliability, promoting transparency, and ensuring that lessons learned from incidents are not forgotten.
